# Learning Data Mining with R
This is the code repository for [Learning Data Mining with R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-data-mining-r-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
##  Data mining is a growing demand on the market as the world is generating data at an increasing pace. R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistical analysis.

This course will get you up and running with the mathematical basics quickly, which you can directly apply based on what youâ€™ve learned in R. This course covers each and every aspect of data mining in order to prepare you for real-world problems. You'll come to understand the different disciplines in data mining and then delve into a variety of algorithms based on each discipline. At least one of the various classes of algorithms will be covered to broaden your knowledge to dive deeper into the different flavors of these algorithms.

After completing this course, you will be able to solve real-world data mining problems.
